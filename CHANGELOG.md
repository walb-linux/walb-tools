## [1.0.15] - 2018-04-05
### Changed
- update cybozulib.
### Fixed
- fix: proxy: kick protocol allows not only Started state but also WlogRecv and WaitForEmtpy.

## [1.0.14] - 2018-03-16
### Added
- `version` command/protocol.
### Fixed
- bugfix: worker: bad replication target when the latest snapshot of destination server is dirty.
- fix: worker: avoid long sleep without quit check.

## [1.0.13] - 2018-03-09
### Changed
- **CAUSION**: internal protocols were changed and renamed.
  - `dirty-full-sync` --> `dirty-full-sync2`
  - `dirty-hash-sync` --> `dirty-hash-sync2`
  - `repl-sync` --> `repl-sync2`
- walb-storage and walb-archive support `-sync-cmpr` option
  to select compression type for full/hash backup
  and full/hash/resync replication.
- walb-storage and walb-proxy support `-maxdelay` option to achieve
  exponential retry intervals.
### Fixed
- bugfix: avoid `bad state:WlogRecv` error due to timing.
- bugfix: can not use spare proxy when walb-proxy reject transfer
  such as `bad state:WlogRecv`.
- fix: improve TaskQueue.
- bugfix: level setting of zstd compression was ignored.
- fix: improve proxy to kick and retry of wdiff transfer.

## [1.0.12] - 2018-02-27
### Changed
- merge task can start during restore/replication client running.
### Fixed
- bugfix: exceptions thrown in MultiThreadedServer::run() when long tasks are running cause
  the state the reject commands via TCP connections until the tasks finish.
- fix: forget to specify `DIRECT_IO`.

## [1.0.11] - 2018-02-15
### Changed
- walb-archive supports `-apply-sleep-pct` option.
- apply/restore tasks use aio instead of noral read/write systemcalls.
### Fixed
- regression: 1.0.9: data lost of dirty full sync server.

## [1.0.10] - 2018-02-08
### Fixed
- bugfix: full replication resume will discard *all* the area of the base image and previous transferred data will be updated by zeroes.

## [1.0.9] - 2018-02-05
### Changed
- change default parameters.
- using TCP backlogs of OS instead of self-managed queues.
### Fixed
- bugfix: connection timeout from walb-storage to walb-proxy causes connection failure to spare proxy.
- full backup/replication uses aio to write base images for performance.

## [1.0.8] - 2018-01-16
### Changed
- force resync if the option is specified in replication command.

## [1.0.7] - 2017-11-17
### Changed
- update cybozulib.
### Fixed
- bugfix: proxy: meta diff garbage may remain and try to send non-existing wdiff files forever.
- bugfix: forget to clean up removing cold snapshots.

## [1.0.6] - 2017-09-14
### Changed
- lvm: use `-K` option for newer lvm tools to activate dm-thin volumes explicitly.
### Fixed
- bugfix: meta: applicable diff searching may fail even if they exist.

## [1.0.5] - 2017-06-18
### Changed
- **CAUSION**: you need not get cybozulib and walb-driver additionaly to build walb-tools now.
  - import cybozulib headers to the walb-tools repository directly.
  - import header files of walb kernel driver to the walb-tools repository directly.
- walb-worker supports `general.timeout` parameter.
- add `get base-all` command.
- support Travis CI.
- fix documents.
### Fixed
- archive: apply/restore can work even if too many wdiff files are required to apply.
- avoid unnecessary read-ahead of log devices.
- improve algorithm of applicable diff list generation.
- and many fixes.

## [1.0.4] - 2017-04-11
### Added
- supports new compression type for wdiffs: lz4 and zstd.
### Chagned
